# An example of bad interleaving and LockfreeUFSet misbehaving

We consider threads 1 and 5 on an Intel 4-core laptop, as they perform union(9,19) concurrently

5: x = 9 // find(9) is 9
5: y = 19
Thread 5 performs link(9,19) while thread 1 does find(9) {
    1: local variable x = 9
    1: enters while loop
}
